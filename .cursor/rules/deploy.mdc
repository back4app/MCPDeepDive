- You're not allowed to use the command "new" alongside the /usr/local/bin/b4a call in any circumstances.
- When deploying files, always include subfolders with assets.
- Do not check if the app's URL is working after deploying
- Do not stop the agent after 25 tool calls. Do as many calls as needed to complete your task.
